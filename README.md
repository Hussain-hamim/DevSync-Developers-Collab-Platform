# DevSync - Developers Collab Platform

That’s a **fantastic idea** — you’re basically designing a **developer collaboration platform** where people can form or join **teams around projects**, assign themselves **roles**, and **collaborate in public**. It blends:

* **Social app**
* **Team building**
* **Open-source spirit**
* **Project-based networking**

Here’s a refined version of your idea with a solid MVP scope:

---

## **DevSync – A Social Platform for Developer Team Collaboration**

### **Core Idea:**

Developers can **create or join teams** working on real projects. Each project lists **open roles** (Frontend, Backend, Designer, etc.), and devs can pick one and start contributing.

---

### **Key Features (MVP)**

#### 1. **Authentication**

* Sign in with GitHub or email
* Profile includes skills, tech stack, and role preferences

#### 2. **Project Creation**

* Any user can create a project with:

  * Title, description, tech stack
  * Roles needed (customizable: "Backend dev", "UI/UX", "API tester")
  * GitHub repo link (optional)

#### 3. **Teams & Roles**

* Users can:

  * View open roles on a project
  * Join a project by claiming a role
* Projects show the current team roster (like “Hamim – Frontend”)

#### 4. **Activity Feed**

* Teams have a private or public activity feed:

  * “Hamim added login page”
  * “Sara fixed API bug”
* AI can summarize daily team activity

#### 5. **Chat or Comments**

* Project page has basic comments or discussion section
  (Can expand to live chat later)

#### 6. **Discover Projects**

* Browse all public projects
* Filter by tech stack, role needed, or active teams

#### 7. **AI Assistant (optional but cool)**

* Suggest role matches for users
* Recommend improvements to project plans
* Summarize GitHub commits or team discussions

#### 8. Project Rankings
Weekly and monthly leaderboard:

Ranked by activity score:

New members

Team posts

GitHub commits (if integrated)

Likes/comments on project feed

Example:
#1 “CodeMatch” — 85 activity points (5 commits, 3 new members, 12 posts)

---

### **Tech Stack (Next.js + MongoDB + Optional AI)**

* **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Clerk/Auth.js
* **Backend API**: Next.js API routes or server actions
* **DB**: MongoDB (teams, users, projects, roles)
* **AI**: OpenAI (summaries, recommendations, suggestions)

---

### **MongoDB Schemas (Sample)**

```js
// User
{
  name,
  email,
  bio,
  skills: [‘React’, ‘Node’],
  rolesInterested: [‘Frontend’, ‘DevOps’],
  joinedProjects: [projectId]
}

// Project
{
  title,
  description,
  techStack: [‘Next.js’, ‘MongoDB’],
  creatorId,
  githubLink,
  roles: [
    { title: "Frontend", filledBy: userId || null },
    { title: "Backend", filledBy: null }
  ],
  team: [userId],
  createdAt
}

// TeamActivity
{
  projectId,
  userId,
  message: "Added homepage layout",
  createdAt
}
```

---

### **Extra Features You Can Add Later**

* GitHub integration to show commit activity
* Reputation/points system for team contributions
* AI teammate that suggests tasks based on project goals
* Weekly digest email of team progress
* Mobile version with push notifications

---

### Let’s Build This

Want me to sketch:

* A Next.js **folder layout** for MVP?
* Or a **feature roadmap with weekly build goals**?
* Or start with just **MongoDB schema and first API**?

Let’s get you building this — it has **real value**, potential for virality, and looks **great on your portfolio**.
